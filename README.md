Creating the Loot Dropdown:

Dropdown, that creates a dropdown UI element with various loot qualities (Poor, Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary, and Artifact), which helps players easily identify the quality of loot.

The dropdown is movable, meaning players can drag and place it anywhere on their screen for convenience, making the interface more flexible.

Enhanced User Control:

The ability to move the dropdown and toggle its visibility via a slash command gives the player control over their UI. Players can place the dropdown where they find it most convenient or hide it when it's not needed, improving overall user satisfaction with the interface.

Visual Clarity:

Using color-coded loot quality options (e.g., gray for Poor, green for Uncommon, etc.) allows players to quickly and easily distinguish between different loot qualities. This reduces confusion and helps players make faster decisions about their loot preferences.

Seamless Integration with Game Systems:

The dropdown dynamically updates with the current loot threshold, ensuring that the UI remains consistent with the player's choices, even if they change their loot preferences outside of the dropdown menu.

Improved Accessibility and Efficiency:

The ability to quickly toggle the visibility of the dropdown via a slash command (/mlt) allows for a streamlined experience. Players can adjust the loot threshold without having to navigate through multiple menus, making the interaction faster and more efficient.
